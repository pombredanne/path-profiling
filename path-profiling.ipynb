    "# Path profiling with sketches\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to characterize how process control moves through a graph over time, _path profiling_ is a general approach that captures detail that node or edge profiling might miss.  Depending on the concrete application of path profiling, several engineering constraints may be more or less important:  do we want to count a small number of paths quickly and precisely or a much larger number of paths scalably?\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic approach of [Ball and Larus](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=243857) ([pdf](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.138.7451&rep=rep1&type=pdf)) provides an efficient technique for tracking acyclic intraprocedural paths through the control-flow graphs (CFG) of compiled programs.  Essentially, each possible path is represented by an integer, which is constructed by setting bits on block entry.  (Their technique constructs a spanning tree of the CFG so that it doesn't have to set bits after _every_ branch.)  The path numbering then indexes into an array of counters (for functions with a small number of possible paths) or into a (precise) hash table of counters (for functions with a large number of possible paths but sparsely-distributed actual paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll evaluate path profiling for a different problem with different constraints:  profiling the top paths to exceptional states in synthetic business process flowcharts.  The charts resemble function control-flow graphs but may have substantially more nodes than a typical compiled function and (especially since we may want to explicitly consider cycles, at least up to a certain loop count) substantially longer paths.  We also would like to maintain a separate profile for the paths leading to each terminal node, so that we can identify the most likely ways to get to a particular exceptional state and use this information to refine our processes.  Since compiled functions are typically small and the basic blocks within these may only have fewer than ten instructions, the cost of explicitly updating a counter upon entering a block (let alone building a dynamic structure to represent a path) may be prohibitive.  By contrast, the processes we're interested in modeling are made up of nodes that take longer to execute than a basic block, so we can maintain a dynamic path until a terminal node -- the problem is that we may not be able to precisely count the number of paths we've encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll handle this problem by using a sketch to track the top *k* paths to each terminal node."
