    "# Path profiling with sketches\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to characterize how process control moves through a graph over time, _path profiling_ is a general approach that captures detail that node or edge profiling might miss.  Depending on the concrete application of path profiling, several engineering constraints may be more or less important:  do we want to count a small number of paths quickly and precisely or a much larger number of paths scalably?\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic approach of [Ball and Larus](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=243857) ([pdf](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.138.7451&rep=rep1&type=pdf)) provides an efficient technique for tracking acyclic intraprocedural paths through the control-flow graphs (CFG) of compiled programs.  Essentially, each possible path is represented by an integer, which is constructed by setting bits on block entry.  (Their technique constructs a spanning tree of the CFG so that it doesn't have to set bits after _every_ branch.)  The path numbering then indexes into an array of counters (for functions with a small number of possible paths) or into a (precise) hash table of counters (for functions with a large number of possible paths but sparsely-distributed actual paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll evaluate path profiling for a different problem with different constraints:  profiling the top paths to exceptional states in synthetic business process flowcharts.  The charts resemble function control-flow graphs but may have substantially more nodes than a typical compiled function and (especially since we may want to explicitly consider cycles, at least up to a certain loop bound) substantially longer paths.  We also would like to maintain a separate profile for the paths leading to each terminal node, so that we can identify the most likely ways to get to a particular exceptional state and use this information to refine our processes.\n",
